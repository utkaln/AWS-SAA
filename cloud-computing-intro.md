# Cloud Computing Introduction

## Advantages of Cloud Computing
1. Pay only for what you use by elastic provisioning of resources
2. Cost benefit from Economies of Scale
3. Stop guessing or planning capacity
4. Increase speed and agility of product development
5. Realize Cost Saving
6. Go global quickly

## Regions | Availability Zones | Edge Locations
- ***AWS Region*** is a area that has multiple data centers that can be created as one network. Globally about 20 regions are present
- ***Availability Zone** is a data center which belongs to a Region. Each Availability zone is independently powered and run, to provide resilience and high availability
- ***Edge Locations** are places in addition to region, where content can be cached to reduce network latency for end users. These are places where nearest region can still incur latency

### Factors help deciding about going Multi Region
1. ***Compliance*** : Government regulations may limit or enforce using multiple regions
2. ***Latency*** : Network latency may become a factor to choosing a Region near to end users
3. ***Pricing*** : Resources, managed services may cost differently in different regions
4. ***Service Availability*** : Resources, Services may or may not be available in the target zone
